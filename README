There are three files here, not including this one.

    database    
        + python pickle file containing a dictionary. The dictionary has two keys, "items" and "creatures" which themselves are dictionaries of Item and Creature objects. These are both accessed by the manager script. 

    sw_classes
        + instantiates a couple of classes that are used by the manager script

    manager.py
        + run either directly like './manager.py' or, I presume, like 'python3 manager'
        + it enters a little environment where you can interact with the objects in the database

TODO:
    + write the todo file
